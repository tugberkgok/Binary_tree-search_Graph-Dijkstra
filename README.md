In these projects I tried to learn **How these algorithms  works?**

**Bubble Shorting**: This shorthing algorithm is one of easiest to use. This
algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

**Binary Seach**: t works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that
 could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

**Dijkstra**: This algorithm finds shortest way between with two nodes.
